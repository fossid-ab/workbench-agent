# Workbench-Agent

## Overview

The **Workbench-Agent** is a Python script used for integrating with **FossID Workbench** in CI/CD pipelines. It leverages the
Workbench API in order to upload code, scan code and retrieve various types of results.

There are various scenarios for integrating the Workbench into a CI/CD pipeline, each with its own pros and cons. Those 
scenarios are presented in the Workbench documentation.

At this moment the Workbench-Agent supports two scenarios: 

- Upload code directly to Workbench

- Generate hashes locally using **fossid-cli** and upload those to Workbench (also known as a blind scan). 

### 1. Upload code directly to Workbench 

WB-Agent Calls Workbench API and creates project and scan (or uses already existing one with given project/scan code)

Uploads files from given path via Workbench API. Extract archives API actions is also called to expand any uploaded archive.

Initiates scan, usually with auto id and delta scan enabled

Checks status in a loop. Use also a max limit of time to stop on malfunctioning scans.

When scan finishes can return various type of results: list of all licenses identified, list of all components found, 
policy warnings at scan or project level. Also saves results to a file specified by parameter --path-result PATH_RESULT

Below are some pros and cons compared with other integration scenarios:

#### Pros:
- local file content is available when inspecting the files in Workbench

- no need to manually expand .war/.jar files, this is handled in the Workbench

#### Cons:
- much larger files to be uploaded to the Workbench resulting in possibly longer execution time of the pipeline.

 

### 2. Generate hashes using fossid-cli and upload those to Workbench (blind scan)

Requires fossid-cli for generating file signatures using the --local flag. Usually WB-Agent is distributed in a container
image containing also fossid-cli and Shinobi License Extractor. This image can be easily pulled in CI/CD pipelines from
a container repository.

Saves file signatures on a temporary file with .fossid extension

Calls Workbench API and create project and scan (or use already existing one with give project/scan code)

Uploads .fossid file via Workbench API

Initiates scan, usually with auto id and delta scan enabled

Checks status in a loop. Use also a max limit of time to stop on malfunctioning scans.

When scan finishes can return various type of results: list of all licenses identified, list of all components found, 
policy warnings at scan or project level. Also saves results to a file specified by parameter --path-result PATH_RESULT

Blind scan can be combined with --dependency-analysis if the Workbench instance were the results are uploaded is configured to use FDA.
Please note that actual content of package manifest files is uploaded (not hashed) to WB instance.

Below are some pros and cons compared with other integration scenarios:

##### Pros:

- no need to make code available to Workbench avoiding large files being uploaded

- easy setup

#### Cons:

- the scanned files (local files) will not be available for comparison with matches in Workbench UI.
